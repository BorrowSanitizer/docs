# Development Guide

BorrowSanitizer uses several extensions to the Rust and LLVM toolchains.

## System Overview

Our Cargo plugin builds an instrumented [sysroot](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/bootstrapping/what-bootstrapping-does.html?highlight=sysroot#what-is-a-sysroot) by redirecting compiler invocations through our Rustc plugin, which adds the flags for enabling BorrowSanitizer. This saves time when switching between projects. Otherwise, users would need to rebuild Rust's standard library by passing `-Zbuild-std` for every project that they want to use with BorrowSanitizer. Any static optimizations that require Rust-specific type information will be implemented within the Rustc plugin. 

We modified the Rust compiler to accept `borrow` as one of the options for `-Z sanitizer=...`. If this option is enabled, then the compiler will emit "retag" instructions, which create new permissions for references. This has a  effect similar to the flag `-Zmir-emit-retag`, which Miri uses to emit retags. However, Miri only emits retags for a subset of operations, the rest are executed implicitly as side-effects of the interpreter. We emit retags everywhere that they are necessary for Tree Borrows. Our retags are lowered to LLVM as calls to a new intrinsic functionâ€”`@llvm.retag`.k Our LLVM insturmentation pass replaces this function with a call to our runtime library. The arguments of this intrinsic will capture all of the Rust-specific type information that we need to instrument LLVM IR for detecting aliasing violations. All other run-time checks are inserted in the backend by the LLVM pass. 

Our runtime library is implemented as two components. The first component is implemented in C++ using the LLVM Sanitizer API. This component redirects our runtime checks to a *Rust* runtime library, where we implement the semantics of Rust's aliasing model and all necessary operations for initializing and accessing values in shadow memory. This design allows us to reuse Miri's implementation of Tree Borrows. It will also make it easier to port our approach to other Rust backends, since developers will only need to reimplement our instrumentation pass. Eventually, we will distribute these libraries as LLVM IR, which our Cargo plugin will statically link against the source program using Cross-Language LTO. This will allows us to gain performance through inlining. They are dynamically linked for now, though.
